This environment allows one to
1. organize the code into a folder [[./myrepo/][=myrepo/=]] and its corresponding test folder [[./tests/][=tests/=]],
2. dockerize as image =myimage= and service =myservice= with [[https://docs.docker.com/compose/][=Docker Compose=]],
3. test Python code with [[https://docs.pytest.org][=pytest=]], 
4. run pre-commit checks with [[https://pre-commit.com/][=pre-commit=]], and
5. package Python code as =mypackage= with [[https://python-poetry.org][=Poetry=]].
